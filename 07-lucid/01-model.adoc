= Lucid Models

toc::[]

Lucid is an implementation of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern[Active Record, window="_blank"] pattern in Javascript. If you are coming from the *Laravel* or the *Rails* world, then you may be quite familiar with it.

== Introduction
The reason behind using Models over writing plain database queries is the ease of use and the powerful API to drive the data flow. Lucid models under the hood takes care of

1. Fetching, persisting model instance transparently.
2. Expressive API to manage relationships.
+
[source, javascript]
----
class User extends Model {

  profile () {
    return this.hasOne('App/Models/Profile')
  }

  posts () {
    return this.hasMany('App/Models/Post')
  }

}
----
3. Define life-cycle hooks to keep your code DRY.
4. Getters/Setters to mutate data on the fly.
5. Serialize data using *serializers*, *computed properties* etc.
6. Manage date formats.
7. and much more.

NOTE: Lucid models are not tied to your database schema and instead manages everything of their own. +
*For example*: There is no need to define associations in SQL when using lucid relationships.

The lucid models are stored as ES6 classes inside `app/Models` directory, where each model represents a database table. For example

[options="header"]
|====
| Model | Database table
| User | users
| Post | posts
|====

== Basic Example
Let's see how to create and make use of a Model to read/write to the database. You can make use of the `adonis` command to generate a model.

=== Creating model
[source, bash]
----
adonis make:model User

# or with migration
adonis make:model User --migration
----

.Output
[source, bash]
----
âœ” create  app/Models/User.js
----

[source, js]
----
'use strict'

const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
}

module.exports = User
----

=== Fetching users
Now inside the routes file, we use the *User* model to fetch all users.

.start/routes.js
[source, js]
----
const Route = use('Route')
const User = use('App/Models/User')

Route.get('users', async () => {
  return await User.all()
})
----

=== Creating user

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = new User()

user.username = 'virk'
user.password = 'some-password'

await user.save()
----

== Convention over configuration
Lucid models do a lot based on certain conventions, but of course, you are free to override the defaults with your settings.

==== table
The table name is always the *lowercase* and *plural* form of the model name. However, you can override it defining a getter.

[source, js]
----
class User extends Model {
  static get table () {
    return 'my_users'
  }
}
----

==== connection
By default, models make use of the default connection defined inside `config/database.js` file. However, you can set a different database connection for each model.

[source, js]
----
class User extends Model {
  static get connection () {
    return 'mysql'
  }
}
----

==== primaryKey
The primary key is set as `id` by default. However, you can mark a different field as the primary key. Also, make sure that the value of this field should always be unique.

[source, js]
----
class User extends Model {
  static get primaryKey () {
    return 'uid'
  }
}
----

==== createdAtColumn
The field name to be used for setting created at the time stamp.

[source, js]
----
class User extends Model {
  static get createdAtColumn () {
    return 'created_at'
  }
}
----

==== updatedAtColumn
The field name to be used for setting updated at the time stamp.

[source, js]
----
class User extends Model {
  static get updatedAtColumn () {
    return 'updated_at'
  }
}
----


== Dates
Dates are the hardest part of building data driver applications. We want to store them differently and show them differently, which usually requires much manual work.

Lucid handles date gracefully so that you have minimal work to do.

=== Defining date fields
The first step is to tell Lucid, which all fields are supposed to be treated as dates. By default, the timestamps `created_at` and `updated_at` are marked as dates.

However, you can define your own too.

[source, js]
----
class User extends Model {
  static get dates () {
    return super.dates.concat(['dob'])
  }
}
----

So here we pull the fields which are marked as dates by default and push a new date field to it and finally returns it.

=== Formatting date fields
Lucid formats all dates as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` by default, which is a valid format for all database engines. Also, it gives you a way to conditionally format certain or all date fields.

NOTE: The `formatDates` method is called before saving the model instance to the database. So make sure the return value is always a valid format for the database engine you are using.

[source, js]
----
class User extends Model {
  static formatDates (field, value) {
    if (field === 'dob') {
      return value.format('YYYY-MM-DD')
    }
    return super.formatDates(field, value)
  }
}
----

The `value` is the actual date given when setting the field.

=== Casting dates
Now we have saved the dates to the database; we may want to format them differently when displaying it to the user. It can be done quite easily using the `castDates` method.

[source, js]
----
class User extends Model {
  static castDates (field, value) {
    if (field === 'dob') {
      return `${value.fromNow(true)} old`
    }
    return super.formatDates(field, value)
  }
}
----

The `value` is an instance of link:https://momentjs.com/[moment.js, window="_blank"], which means you can call any moment methods to format the date. Also, the `castDates` method is called when the model instance is *deserialized*, which happens after calling `toJSON`.

[source, js]
----
const users = await User.all()

// converting to JSON array
const usersJSON = users.toJSON()
----

== Query builder
Lucid models make use of link:query-builder[database query builder] to run database queries. You can obtain an instance of query builder by calling `query` method on a model.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const adults = await User
  .query()
  .where('age', '>', 18)
  .fetch()
----

1. All of the query builder methods are fully supported.
2. With lucid models, you are supposed to call `fetch` method to execute the query. It is required to get results back within an instance of `serializer` ( learn more about link:serializers[serializers] ).

== Static methods
Lucid models come with a bunch of static methods to do common operations without using the query builder interface.

Also, there is no need to call `fetch` when using one of the following static methods.

==== find
Find a record using for the primary key. Always returns one record.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
await User.find(1)
----

==== findOrFail
Same as the `find` method but instead throws `ModelNotFoundException` when unable to find a record.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
await User.findOrFail(1)
----

==== findBy / findByOrFail
Find a record using a key/value pair. Returns the first matching record.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
await User.findBy('email', 'foo@bar.com')

// or
await User.findByOrFail('email', 'foo@bar.com')
----

==== first / firstOrFail
Find the first row from the database.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
await User.first()

// or
await User.firstOrFail()
----

==== pick(rows = 1)
Pick `x` number of rows from the database table. By default it only selects `1` row.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
await User.pick(3)
----

==== pickInverse(rows = 1)
Pick `x` number of rows from the database table from last. By default it only selects `1` row.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
await User.pickInverse(3)
----

==== ids
Returns an array of primary keys. If the primary key is defined as `uid`, then it is an array of `uid's`.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const userIds = await User.ids()
----

==== pair(lhs, rhs)
Returns an object of key/value pair. The `lhs` field is the object key, and `rhs` is the value.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const users = await User.pair('id', 'country')

// returns { 1: 'ind', 2: 'uk' }
----

==== all
Select all rows

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const users = await User.all()
----

==== reset
Delete all rows (truncate table)

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const users = await User.reset()
----

== Aggregate helpers
Lucid aggregate helpers provide shortcut access to common aggregate queries without using the query builder interface. These same queries can be written long-form using the query builder interface. Short and long-form examples are provided for each helper method.

There is no need to call `fetch` when using one of the following static methods. These methods end the query builder chaining and return a value.

All helpers accept a column name to be used for aggregation. When possible Lucid will choose a default for the column name. Some methods, such as `sum()`, require a column name.

==== rowsCount(columnName = '*')
Return a count of records in a given result set.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

# Return count of all records in table
await User.rowsCount()

# Return count of selected records
await User.query().rowsCount()

# Return count of selected records (long form)
(await User.query().count('* as total'))[0].total
----

==== sum(columnName)
Return a sum of records in a given result set.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

# Return sum of all records in table
await User.sum('friends_count')

# Return sum of selected records
await User.query().sum('friends_count')

# Return sum of selected records (long form)
(await User.query().sum('friends_count as total'))[0].total
----


== Query scopes
Query scopes are convenient methods to extract query constraints to useable and powerful methods. For example, we want to fetch all those users, who have a profile

[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  static scopeHasProfile (query) {
    return query.has('profile')
  }

  profile () {
    return this.hasOne('App/Models/Profile')
  }
}
----

So, now you can use it as

[source, js]
----
const users = await User.query().hasProfile().fetch()
----

The idea of query scopes is to make your code more readable as if you are reading plain text.

1. The scopes are always defined with a keyword called `scope`, followed by the method name.
2. When using the scope, you can call the method by dropping the `scope` keyword and calling the method in *camelCase* form.
3. You can call all standard query builder methods inside a query scope.


== Pagination
Lucid also supports the `paginate` method from the query builder.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const page = 1

const users = await User.query().paginate(page)

return view.render('users', { users: users.toJSON() })
----

The return value of `paginate` is not an array of users. Instead, it is an object with metadata and `data` property that has a list of users.

[source, js]
----
{
  total: '',
  perPage: '',
  lastPage: '',
  page: '',
  data: []
}
----

== Inserts & Updates
With models instead of inserting raw values to the database, you persist the model instance which in turn makes the insert query for you. For example

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = new User()
user.username = 'virk'
user.email = 'foo@bar.com'

await user.save()
----

The `save` method persists the instance to the database. Also, it smartly figures out whether to create a new row or update the existing row. For example:

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = new User()
user.username = 'virk'
user.email = 'foo@bar.com'

// Insert
await user.save()

user.age = 22

// Update
await user.save()
----

The `update` query only takes place if something has been changed. Calling `save` for multiple times, without updating the model attributes does not perform any queries.

Rather than setting attributes manually, the `fill` or `merge` methods may be used.

The `fill` method will override all existing key/pair values of the model instance.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = new User()
user.username = 'virk'
user.age = 22

user.fill({ age: 23 }) // remove existing values, only set age.

await user.save()

// returns { age: 23, username: null }
----

The `merge` method only modifies the specified attributes

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const user = new User()
user.fill({ username: 'virk', age: 22 })

user.merge({ age: 23 })

await user.save()

// returns { age: 23, username: 'virk' }
----

==== create
Alternatively, you can also feed a bunch of data directly to the model instance, instead of setting attributes manually.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const userData = request.only(['username', 'email', 'age'])

// save and get instance back
const user = await User.create(userData)
----

==== createMany
Just like `create` you can persist multiple instances of a model using the createMany method.

NOTE: The `createMany` method makes *n* number of queries instead of doing a bulk insert, where *n* is the number of rows.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')
const usersData = request.collect(['username' 'email', 'age'])

const users = await User.createMany(usersData)
----

=== Bulk updates
The bulk updates can be done with the help of query builder. Lucid makes sure to format dates accordingly when doing bulk updates.

*Bulk updates never executes any model hooks*.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

await User
  .query()
  .where('username', 'virk')
  .update({ role: 'admin' })
----

== Deletes
A single model instance can be deleted by calling the delete method.

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

const { id } = params
const user = await User.find(id)

await user.delete()
----

After calling `delete` method, the model instance freezes for any updates, but you can still read data from it.

[source, js]
----
await user.delete()

console.log(user.id) // works fine

user.id = 1 // throws exception
----

=== Bulk deletes
Bulk deletes can be done with the help of query builder.

*Bulk deletes never executes any model hooks.*

[source, js]
----
const User = use('App/Models/User')

await User
  .query()
  .where('role', 'guest')
  .delete()
----

== Boot cycle
Each model has a boot cycle where it gets booted, and that happens only for once. So if you want to perform something that should occur only once, consider writing it inside the `boot` method.

[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  static boot () {
    super.boot()

    /**
      I will be called only once
    */
  }
}

module.exports = User
----
