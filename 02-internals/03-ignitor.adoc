Ignitor is the package that powers bootstrapping of an AdonisJs application. In this guide, we learn about some features and functionalities offered by this package to manage our code.

== Hooks
link:https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-ignitor[Ignitor, window="_blank"] provides a bunch of hooks that you can use to customize the application behavior. The hooks are registered inside `start/hooks.js` file. Feel free to create this file, if it is missing.

Let's start with an example of register a view global after all the providers have been booted.

[source, js]
----
const { hooks } = require('@adonisjs/ignitor')

hooks.after.providersBooted(() => {
  const View = use('View')
  View.global('time', () => new Date().getTime())
})
----

Just like `hooks.after`, you can make use of `hooks.before` to hook into before something happens. Below is the list of available hooks.

|====
| Hook | Description
| providersRegistered | Before/after all providers have been registered
| providersBooted | Before/after all providers are booted.
| preloading | Before/after pre loading registered files.
| httpServer | Before/after HTTP server has been started.
| aceCommand | Before/after ace command is executed.
|====

== Preloading files
Ignitor also makes it easy to preload a bunch of files after HTTP server has been started. For this, you need to modify `server.js` file and call the following method.

[source, js]
----
new Ignitor(require('@adonisjs/fold'))
  .appRoot(__dirname)
  .preLoad('start/fire-zombies')
  .fireHttpServer()
  .catch(console.error)
----

The `preLoad` method takes a relative path from the application path or an absolute path to any *.js* file. To load multiple files, just call the `preLoad` method for multiple times.

[source, js]
----
new Ignitor(require('@adonisjs/fold'))
  .preLoad('')
  .preLoad('')
----

== Ignitor methods
Below is the list of methods available on the ignitor instance.

==== appRoot(location)
Define absolute path to the application root.

[source, js]
----
ignitor
  .appRoot(__dirname)
----

==== appFile(location)
Relative path to the app file. By default `start/app.js` file is used.

[source, js]
----
ignitor
  .appFile('start/app.js')
----

==== loadCommands()
Instruct ignitor to load ace providers and commands. It is done when running an ace command. However, you can also load commands when starting the HTTP server.

[source, js]
----
ignitor
  .loadCommands()
----
