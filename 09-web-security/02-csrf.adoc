= CSRF protection

toc::[]

link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)[Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF )] allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of another user without their knowledge or permission.

AdonisJs protects your application from CSRF attacks by denying unidentified requests. HTTP requests with *POST, PUT and DELETE* methods are checked to make sure that these requests are invoked by right people from right place.

== Setup
Make sure to install the `shield` provider and register the appropriate middleware.

[source, bash]
----
adonis install @adonisjs/shield
----

Next, register the provider inside `start/app.js` file.

[source, js]
----
const providers = [
  '@adonisjs/shield/providers/ShieldProvider'
]
----

And, finally register the global middleware inside `start/kernel.js` file.

NOTE: Shield middleware relies on link:sessions[sessions], so make sure they are setup correctly.

[source, js]
----
const globalMiddleware = [
  'Adonis/Middleware/Shield'
]
----

== Config
The configuration for CSRF is saved inside `config/shield.js` file.

[source, javascript]
----
csrf: {
  enable: true,
  methods: ['POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  filterUris: ['/user/:id'],
  cookieOptions: {}
}
----

[options="header"]
|====
| Key | Value | Description
| enable  | Boolean | A boolean to turn on/off CSRF for the entire application.
| methods | Array | HTTP verbs to be protected by CSRF. Consider adding all verbs which allow the end user to add or modify data.
| filterUris | Array | A list of URLs/Routes to ignore. You can pass actual routes definition or a regular expression to match.
| cookieOptions | Object | An object of link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie#options-1[cookie options, window="_blank"]
|====

== How It Works?

[ol-spaced]
1. AdonisJs creates a *CSRF secret* for each user visiting your website.
2. A corresponding token for the secret is generated for each request and passed to all views as `csrfToken` and `csrfField()` globals.
3. Also, the same token is set to a cookie with key `XSRF-TOKEN`. Frontend Frameworks like *AngularJs* automatically reads this cookie and send it along with each Ajax request.
4. Whenever a *POST*, *PUT* or *DELETE* requests comes, the middleware verifies the token with the secret to make sure it is valid.

NOTE: If you are using the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie value, then do make sure the header key is `X-XSRT-TOKEN`

== View Helpers
You can access the CSRF token using one of the following view helpers and make sure to set them inside your forms.

To send the token along with each request, you need access to it. There are a few ways to get access to the CSRF token.

==== csrfField
[source, edge]
----
{{ csrfField() }}
----

.Output
[source, html]
----
<input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="xxxxxx">
----

==== csrfToken
The `csrfToken` helper returns the raw value of the token.

[source, edge]
----
{{ csrfToken }}
----

== Handling exception
On validation failure, an exception is thrown with *EBADCSRFTOKEN* code. Make sure to listen for the exception and return an appropriate response.

.app/Exceptions/Handler.js
[source, javascript]
----
class ExceptionHandler {
  async handle (error, { response }) {
    if (error.code === 'EBADCSRFTOKEN') {
      response.forbidden('Cannot process your request.')
      return
    }
  }
}
